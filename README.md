# Recalculate recipients

CiviCRM calculates the recipients for a mailing based on the contacts that are in your include/exclude groups/mailings at the time that you hit the submit button.

This means that any contacts that are added or removed to your groups in the time between when you hit the submit button and the date it is scheduled to go out will not receive your mailing.

This extension causes the recipients of a mailing to be recalculated just before the mail is sent out meaning you'll be sending based on the most up to date recipients.

## Health warning

**Recalculate recipients is currently in beta - use at your own risk.**

The extension has been in production at several organisations for years without issue. We have not had any reports of it breaking anything from other organisations but even so, it has not been widely tested.

*If this extension does work for you, please feedback by creating an issue in the github repostory with details of your use case. Once we have received a few positive reviews, we will move it out of beta.*

### Not ACL friendly

This extension is not ACL friendly. The CiviMail author's ACLs are not taken into account when the recipients are recalculated, meaning thie extension does not limit to the contacts in a group that the user scheduling a mailing is able to view (see [issue #1](https://github.com/3sd/civicrm-recalculate-recipients/issues/1) for more details).

Not not use it if you are relying on ACLs to limit the contacts to which CiviMail users can send
