# Recalculate recipients

CiviCRM calculates the recipients for a mailing based on the contacts that are in your include/exclude groups/mailings at the time that you hit the submit button.

This means that any contacts that are added or removed to your groups in the time between when you hit the submit button and the date it is scheduled to go out will not receive your mailing.

This extension causes the recipients of a mailing to be recalculated just before the mail is sent out meaning you'll be sending based on the most up to data.
